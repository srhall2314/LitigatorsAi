This is a classic error that suggests either fabrication or a significant typographical mistake, but the context correctly describes the diversity jurisdiction statute's requirements (amount in controversy exceeding $75,000 and diversity of citizenship), which are found in 28 U.S.C., not 8 U.S.C.",

ESLU, Inc. is a known case dealing with res judicata and insurance law - The legal proposition cited (res judicata standard for \"raised or could have been raised\") is accurate and commonly cited from this case - The Eleventh Circuit regularly publishes opinions in the F.3d reporter series",
