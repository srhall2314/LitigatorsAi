Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793 (1996) is a well-established Supreme Court precedent directly addressing due process limitations on preclusion doctrine—specifically, the principle that non-parties cannot be bound by judgments in which they did not participate or receive adequate representation. The quoted rule is a foundational principle of civil procedure and constitutional law. The Supreme Court is the appropriate forum for establishing constitutional due process standards. The page citation (797) is plausible for a substantive holding statement. The application to a preliminary award's preclusive effect against a non-party is logically consistent with the authority's scope. No doctrinal implausibilities are evident. Minor uncertainty remains only because deep verification of the exact quote and page placement would require source confirmation, but the citation type, court level, subject matter, and legal principle all align appropriately.","timestamp":"2025-11-28T19:51:17.231Z","model":"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"},{"agent":"reality_assessment_expert_v1","score":10,"reasoning":"No cross-dimensional contradictions detected.

The Eleventh Circuit is the appropriate appellate forum for federal question jurisdiction cases, and res judicata (claim preclusion) is a standard affirmative defense properly addressed in appellate decisions. The reference to a \"four-part test\" for res judicata is consistent with established civil procedure doctrine—courts typically apply multi-factor tests examining: (1) same parties or privies, (2) same cause of action, (3) prior final judgment on the merits, and (4) proper jurisdiction. The case name \"Lobo v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc.\" is generically plausible (cruise line litigation is common in the Eleventh Circuit given Florida jurisdiction), and the page citation (892) is a reasonable depth for a substantive legal holding.
